# Solution Templates

Use these templates to produce consistent principal-PM quality outputs.

## 1) Decision Brief (One Page)

```markdown
# Decision Brief: <decision title>

## Decision
<What must be decided now, by when, and why>

## Context
- User/problem signal:
- Business signal:
- Why now:

## Outcomes and Guardrails
- Primary outcome metric:
- Supporting metrics:
- Guardrails:
- Time horizon:

## Options Considered
1. <Option A>
2. <Option B>
3. <Option C or Do Minimum>

## Recommendation
<Chosen option + one-paragraph rationale>

## Risks
- <Risk 1> -> <Mitigation>
- <Risk 2> -> <Mitigation>

## Next 30-60-90 Days

## 2) Option Comparison Matrix

```markdown
| Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Impact on target outcome | 35 |  |  |  |
| Confidence in results | 20 |  |  |  |
| Time to value | 20 |  |  |  |
| Complexity and delivery risk | 15 |  |  |  |
| Strategic alignment | 10 |  |  |  |
| **Total** | **100** |  |  |  |
```

Scoring guidance:
- Score each criterion from 1-5.
- Multiply score by weight.
- Treat total score as directional; confirm with key non-numeric constraints.
